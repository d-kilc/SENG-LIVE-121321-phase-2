# Activity Instructions

## Break Out Activity #1

- In `CardForm.js`, add necessary callback functions / JSX element attributes to “control” all `<input>`s.

- Extra Credit: Create a state (`formData`) to manage all of our form data.

- Extra Credit: Create ONE callback function to manage the `onChange` behavior for any of our controlled inputs

- Be sure to use the `formView` state in your solution!

## Break Out Activity #2

- Modify `App.js` and `CardForm.js` to dynamically display a list of added Cards as we continue to submit new Card entries.
